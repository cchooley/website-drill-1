        <p class="graphtext">Do I have an original thought in my head? My bald
          head. Maybe if I were happier, my hair wouldn't be falling out. Life
          is short. I need to make the most of it. Today is the first day of the
          rest of my life. I'm a walking clich√©. I really need to go to the
          doctor and have my leg checked. There's something wrong. A bump. The
          dentist called again. I'm way overdue. If I stop putting things off,
          I would be happier. All I do is sit on my fat ass. If my ass wasn't
          fat I would be happier. I wouldn't have to wear these shirts with the
          tails out all the time. Like that's fooling anyone. Fat ass. I should
          start jogging again. Five miles a day. Really do it this time. Maybe
          rock climbing. I need to turn my life around. What do I need to do? I
          need to fall in love. I need to have a girlfriend. I need to read
          more, improve myself. What if I learned Russian or something? Or took
          up an instrument? I could speak Chinese. I'd be the screenwriter who
          speaks Chinese and plays the oboe. That would be cool. I should get my
          hair cut short. Stop trying to fool myself and everyone else into
          thinking I have a full head of hair. How pathetic is that? Just be
          real. Confident. Isn't that what women are attracted to? Men don't
          have to be attractive. But that's not true. Especially these days.
          Almost as much pressure on men as there is on women these days. Why
          should I be made to feel I have to apologize for my existence? Maybe
          it's my brain chemistry. Maybe that's what's wrong with me. Bad
          chemistry. All my problems and anxiety can be reduced to a chemical
          imbalance or some kind of misfiring synapses. I need to get help for
          that. But I'll still be ugly though. Nothing's gonna change that.</p>
        <h3 class="graphheading">From <em>Raising Arizona</em></h3>
        <p class="graphtext">That night I had a dream. I dreamt I was as light
          as the ether- a floating spirit visiting things to come. The shades
          and shadows of the people in my life rassled their way their way into
          my slumber. I dreamed that Gale and Evelle had decided to return to
          prison. Probably that's just as well. I don't mean to sound superior,
          and they're a swell couple of guys, but maybe they weren't ready yet
          to come out into the world. And then I dreamed on, into the future,
          to a Christmas morn in the Arizona home where Nathan Junior was
          opening a present from a kindly couple who preferred to remain
          unknown. I saw Glen a few years later, still having no luck getting
          the cops to listen to his wild tales about me and Ed. Maybe he threw
          in one Polack joke too many. I don't know. And still I dreamed on,
          further into the future than I had ever dreamed before, watching
          Nathan Junior's progress from afar, taking pride in his
          accomplishments as if he were our own. Wondering if he ever thought
          of us and hoping that maybe we'd broadened his horizons a little even
          if he couldn't remember just how they got broadened. But still I
          hadn't dreamt nothing about me and Ed until the end. And this was
          cloudier cause it was years, years away. But I saw an old couple being
          visited by their children, and all their grandchildren too. The old
          couple weren't screwed up. And neither were their kids or their
          grandkids. And I don't know. You tell me. This whole dream, was it
          wishful thinking? Was I just fleeing reality like I know I'm liable to
          do? But me and Ed, we can be good too. And it seemed real. It seemed
          like us and it seemed like, well, our home. If not Arizona, then a
          land not too far away. Where all parents are strong and wise and
          capable and all children are happy and beloved. I don't know. Maybe
          it was Utah.</p>
